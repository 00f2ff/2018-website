TODO: 

	- think more about font pairings / if I want to do something special to this 
	- when / if I do a redesign, consider making separate pages for each link. If I get a lot of content this will likely be necessary. That or a modal, but modals look shitty on mobile, so probably just pages. 
	  - Given that I'll likely use pages, I should consider re-hosting my site as some flavor of node app (simple) to preserve formatting stuff. Maybe check out vue. 

	
	1. Add media queries so this doesn't suck on mobile
	2. Do writeup for console.log that includes styled code blocks showing what logs look like (and what I wish they looked like!)
	2. Think about / design pages for writing, etc.

					<div class="description">
						<p>
							Have you ever seen a performance of <i>Piano Man</i> by Billy Joel and wondered, "could we improve Billy's efficiency by combining his two instruments?" Probably not, but that amalgamation basically describes a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodica">melodica</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							I love my melodica because it allows me to pretend that I actually know how to play piano. This fantasy is often shattered when playing in front of other people because they notice I wrote the musical alphabet on the keys in pencil. Regardless, I consider two of my finer character traits to be relative pitch and persistence (interpret the adjective-noun agreement as you will).
						</p>
						<p>
							In 2016 I began working in the Northeast Megalopolis, but I had a friend in the Cascadia Megalopolis. That's just a pretentious way of saying we worked on different coasts, but I think the word megalopolis sounds about as funny as a melodica, so maybe it's relevant. Anyway, I convinced her to buy a melodica because I thought a great way to stay in touch would be to play duets over Skype. This never worked due to audio lag, but I did write a two-part rendition of <i>Dangerous Woman</i> by Ariana Grande, so I consider it a win.

					<p class="subheader">Things That Stack</p>
					<div class="description">
						<p>
							In July 2017, I drove from Washington, DC to San Francisco, CA. The drive was slow. I have significantly more to say about the drive than a curt, four-letter sentence, but that's for another time. In San Francisco, everything seems fast: the cascade of information, the frenetic herd of grown men riding Swagtron scooters to work, the venturous walk of a man wearing a "Stop Pitching" shirt. Maybe it's just the (non) weather. It's nice not to freeze, but I no longer have a concept of time. Time made sense as a DC elementary student because each season had three months and my favorite book of seasons had four pages. A mathematician at heart, all was well in the universe.
						</p>
						<p>
							I find respite in thinking about ordinary things differently. I enjoy rhyming, and recently was struck by the beautiful synchronicity of <i>rhyme</i> and <i>thyme</i>. "Rhyme thyme" is my new favorite poem because the way the first word lingers on the back of my tongue when reading the second looks like a tingle, and I love puns. Another way to think of things differently is to observe the way in which they stack. Assuming gravity is operating as expected, things stack reliably. In general, gravity provides for a great user experience.
						</p>
						<p>
							I like it when books stack. I think this makes me feel intelligent. I try to ignore the meager number of pages between the front cover and my bookmark. I like it when clothes stack, because I can literally hide my problems from sight with other problems, but then I run out of laundry. I like it when floors stack, because it means a building hasn't fallen, unless the floors are two inches apart, in which case it has. I'm glad when I see a person riding a bike because it means the person has stacked itself on the bike which has stacked itself on the road. I'm less keen on alternative orderings.
						</p>
						<p>
							Thinking about how things stack is an excellent method to get my mind off things like work, plantar fasciitis, the DMV, bacterial antibiotic resistance, etc. I encourage you, the reader, to think about how well we as a species have stacked things over time. Pat yourself on the back, you deserve it.

					<p class="subheader">Catch Ideas</p>
					<div class="description">
						<p>
							I believe that people do themselves a disservice when they don't stop to acknowledge how ridiculous trains of thought are. I think thinking is hilarious, and I enjoy stopping to smell the proverbial roses (which I thought of randomly earlier today and still don't have an inkling as to how they connected to what I was thinking about previously). I derive sly pleasure from sharing my thoughts midstream as it rarely fails to throw people off guard. Cognition is wonky, and we never stop thinking, so how do we choose the demarcations by which we share? I blame society. If you want to giggle more, catch your ideas, savor the qualia, and then let 'em go. I'm not a heathen; this is catch and release.
