        <p>
          I believe that people do themselves a disservice when they don't stop to acknowledge how ridiculous trains of thought are. I think thinking is hilarious, and I enjoy stopping to smell the proverbial roses (which I thought of randomly earlier today and still don't have an inkling as to how they connected to what I was thinking about previously). I derive sly pleasure from sharing my thoughts midstream as it rarely fails to throw people off guard. Cognition is wonky, and we never stop thinking, so how do we choose the demarcations by which we share? I blame society. If you want to giggle more, catch your ideas, savor the qualia, and then let 'em go. I'm not a heathen; this is catch and release.
